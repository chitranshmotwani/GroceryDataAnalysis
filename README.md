## **Files and Purpose**

### **Data Files**
- **`product.csv`**: Contains metadata for products, such as name, brand, and units.
- **`raw.csv`**: Time-series price data, including timestamps, current prices, and sale prices.
- **`cleaned_merged_data.csv`**: Preprocessed dataset with additional features for analysis.

### **Notebooks**
- **`cheapest_vendor.ipynb`**: Identify the vendor offering the lowest prices across categories.  
- **`price_change_cluster.ipynb`**: Perform clustering analysis to group vendors based on price change behaviors.  
- **`pricing_strategies.ipynb`**: Derive insights and recommendations for optimal pricing strategies.  
- **`pricing_trends_milk.ipynb`**: Analyze pricing trends specifically for milk products to uncover key patterns.  
- **`sandwich_pricing.ipynb`**: Investigate pricing strategies and trends for sandwiches to enhance competitive positioning.  

### **Scripts**
- **`preprocess.py`**: Automates data cleaning and feature engineering.

### **Reports and Visuals**
- **`report.pdf`**: Comprehensive report summarizing findings and recommendations.

## **Key Deliverables**

1. **Cleaned Dataset**:
-cleaned_merged.csv
-milk.csv
2. **Comprehensive Report**:
report.pdf

## **Key Analyses**

1. **Pricing Trends**
-- pricing_strategies.ipynb
-- pricing_trends_milk.ipynb
-- sandwich_pricing.ipynb

2. **Vendor Comparison**
-- cheapest_vendor.ipynb
-- price_change_cluster.ipynb

**Known Issues Resolved**

- **Duplicate Price Entries**: Resolved by deduplicating based on product IDs and consolidating prices for entries that appeared multiple times on the same day.
- **Inconsistent Vendor Names**: Standardization of vendor names ensures consistency across the dataset.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Implemented strategies for handling missing values and ensuring that important columns (like product names) are not empty.
- **Data Type Inconsistencies**: Ensured all numeric values are properly converted and validated to prevent analysis errors.


## **Reporting and Visualization**
- **Generate visualizations using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.**
- **Create a report.**

## **Setup and Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chitranshmotwani/GroceryDataAnalysis.git
cd GroceryDataAnalysis
```

### **2. Install Required Packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Download Required Data Files**
1. Download the zip file containing the data from the following link: [Download Hammer Data](https://jacobfilipp.com/hammerdata/hammer-5-csv.zip).
2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Place the `hammer-4-raw.csv` and `hammer-4-product.csv` files into the `data` folder within your cloned repository.

### **4. Run Preprocessing Script**
```bash
python scripts/preprocess.py
```
This will generate the `cleaned_merged_data.csv` file, which is required for the subsequent analysis.

### **5. Run Scripts**
After preprocessing, you can run the analysis files in the `notebooks` folder as needed.
